        <h2>Computing for Interactive Arts Minor</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">The minor in Computing for Interactive Arts (CIA) is a Cross Disciplinary Studies Minor jointly offered by the Department of Art and Design and the Computer Science Department. The CIA minor fosters a collaborative, cross-disciplinary environment in which Art and Design students integrate coding and algorithmic thinking in creative works and Computer Science students apply the principles and methodology of design thinking to visual applications. The minor enables students from different disciplines to collaborate on projects requiring both a technical and a creative perspective.
Students wanting to learn more about the minor can contact the CIA minor advisors: Christian Eckhardt and Enrica Lovaglio Costello.</p>
        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">The CIA Minor is only open to students majoring in Computer Science (CSC), Computer Engineering (CPE), Software Engineering (SE) or Art and Design (ART). 
Students can only minor in ONE of the following minors: Computer Science, Data Science or Computing for Interactive Arts.
The following prerequisite courses should be taken prior to applying to the CIA Minor:
ART 182 (offered Fall Quarter only)
